            <b>Chicken and Spinach Rice Casserole</b>

<p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>

<p>1 1/2 lb of chicken</p>
<p>1 cup of rice</p>
<p>2 cups of fresh spinach</p>
<p>1 bunch of asparagus</p>
<p>1 cup of yogurt</p>
<p>2 slices of bread</p>
<p>Salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p>1 tsp of garlic powder</p>
<p>1/2 tsp of onion powder</p>
<p>1 cup of grated cheese for garnishing (optional)</p>


<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>

<p>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Rinse chicken and pat dry. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.</p>

<p>Step 2: In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and sear both sides until golden brown. This will not completely cook the chicken; it is to seal the juices in. Remove the chicken from the heat and set it aside.</p>

<p>Step 3: In the same skillet, toss in trimmed asparagus and spinach. Let it cook until the spinach wilts, then remove from heat.</p>

<p>Step 4: Cook the rice as per the instructions on the packet and set it aside. For more flavor, you can cook the rice with chicken or vegetable broth.</p>

<p>Step 5: In a casserole dish, layer the cooked rice, followed by the sautéed asparagus and spinach. Place the seared chicken on top.</p>

<p>Step 6: Over the chicken, spread 1 cup of yogurt evenly. Place the bread slices on top. If you like, you can toast the bread beforehand or use breadcrumbs.</p>

<p>Step 7: Bake the casserole for 30-40 minutes or until the chicken is cooked all the way through (reaching an internal temperature of 165°F / 74°C). For the final 10 minutes of baking, you can add a layer of grated cheese on top for an extra touch.</p>

<p>Enjoy your hearty Chicken and Spinach Rice Casserole!</p>
